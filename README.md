Metrics [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dropwizard/metrics.png)](http://travis-ci.org/dropwizard/metrics)
=======

**This is a Fork!**

We've forked from [dropwizard/metrics](http://github.com/dropwizard/metrics) in order to back-port [this java7 fix](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/pull/757). The fix doesn't work on java6, so we've had to fork and release a java7 version for ourselves. Please refer to the [main repository](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics) for any issues elsewhere.

*Capturing JVM- and application-level metrics. So you know what's going on.*

For more information, please see [the documentation](http://dropwizard.github.io/metrics/).
